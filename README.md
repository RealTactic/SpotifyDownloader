# SpotifyLoader
Download spotify music given a link. Download albums, playlists or tracks

# Description:
This program was made to download spotify music (from youtube) given a spotify link.
It will automatically fetch cover art and metadata (ID3 tags) and add them to 
downloaded files. This is a one man project which I made to be open source for others to use. :)

Input any spotify 'track', 'album' or 'playlist' url as a parameter to start.
If no urls are supplied, program will run normally with any specified flags.
When inputting parameters, you may input multiple links at a time.

help | Show the help menu.

-y   | Force program to continue without asking user for confirmation.

-T   | Set custom amount of MAX download threads.


I hope this dosn't have any bugs :( but to the best of my knowledge it works.
Hope you enjoy. :)
